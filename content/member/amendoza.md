I’m an intended-applied mathematics major at U.C. Berkeley with a strong interest in cancer genomics, machine learning, and web development. I’ve previously interned in wet labs on immunometabolism and virology research at the Jackson Laboratory and at U.C. Berkeley, respectively. I’ve recently switched over to bioinformatics research as it provides a larger impact that I seek. I’ve interned at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center where I analyzed genomic data for a rare cancer type. I’m hoping to work on a similar project as part of the Holmes Lab.

In my free time, I enjoy to cycle, go swimming, and cook different recipes.
